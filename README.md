### Bike Utilization
* Bikes are evenly used for total ride count. 
* Around 1/4 of bikes are predominantly used and can be expected to need inspection for repairs.
   * This can be avoided with a bike rotation program to swap bikes from high traffic areas to low traffic areas to have even further total bike utilization.

## Summary

* There is both a high **male** and **subcriber** user base.
* High traffic during typical transit time to and from work. (As well being busy consistantly all day on weekends)
* Further analysis is required on the Des Moines market to see if there is a large male population that would be open to biking to and from work.
* Additonally, to determine if this will be a profitable business model we need to conduct an analysis of the sales and revenue of Citi Bike to determine what the investors return on investment will be.
